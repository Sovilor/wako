## Do you want to contribute by translating your app in your own language?

wako uses translatation files located here https://github.com/wako-app/wako/tree/master/i18n to display the app in the user choosen lang. 

The default translatation file is the English one: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wako-app/wako/master/i18n/en.json, which mean that if any translatation `key` is missing in the user selected language, it will use the English value instead.

- If you want to add a new language, go to https://github.com/wako-app/wako/tree/master/i18n and click on the `Create new file` button. Then copy/paste the content of the [English version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wako-app/wako/master/i18n/en.json) and start translate the `values`.
- If you want to edit a language, select the desired language from https://github.com/wako-app/wako/tree/master/i18n and click on the `edit` button (the pen icon).
